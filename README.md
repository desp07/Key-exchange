# Key exchange algorithms

This repository contains the implementation of two key exchange algorithms described in the following papers.

- A Lightweight Anonymous Mutual Authentication with Key Agreement Protocol on ECC (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8029437)

- An improved authenticated key agreement protocol for low power networks (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6820572)

The key exchange programs are written in C programming language and were used to examine the possibility of implementing encryption in the Modbus protocol. They are not stand alone applications since they were created as an addition to an open source C Modbus library.

A part of the results of this implementation is presented in the following publication: https://www.mdpi.com/1999-5903/14/8/232
